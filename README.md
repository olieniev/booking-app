## Accommodation booking API

### ‚úèÔ∏è Intro
Welcome to Accommodation booking API - the second big project I've done using Spring Boot to master my existing skills and get the new ones along the way. 
It's an API that allows users to make bookings of existing properties offered by Administrators or even other users! It has secure authentication/authorization, notification system using Telegram API and integrated payment system, a.k.a. Stripe.
Let me guide you through the details.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges faced
- First real 3rd party API integration - Telegram ‚úÖ
- First real payment integration using Stripe ‚úÖ
- Scheduled job logic implementation to identify and release expired bookings ‚úÖ
- One more thing: implemented unit tests indeed helped me to identify bugs and fix inefficiencies, which I am really happy about.
